# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

For this project, I have chosen to use Windows 11 as my operating system. Windows 11 is a widely adopted and user-friendly operating system that provides excellent compatibility with various development tools and applications.
Download and Installation Steps:

Visit the official Microsoft Windows 11 download page: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
Click on the "Download now" button to initiate the download process.
Once the download is complete, run the installer file.
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

I have selected Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my primary text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project. VSCode is a popular, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft that offers a rich set of features, including code highlighting, debugging, version control integration, and a vast ecosystem of extensions and plugins.
Download and Installation Steps:

Visit the official Visual Studio Code download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (in this case, Windows).
Download the installer and run it.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
   
4. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

Version Control System Setup
For version control, I have chosen to use Git, a widely adopted distributed version control system, and GitHub, a popular web-based hosting service for Git repositories.
Git Installation Steps:

Visit the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Download the latest version of Git for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

GitHub Account Creation:

Visit the GitHub website: https://github.com
Click on the "Sign up" button to create a new account.
Follow the registration process by providing the required information.

After installing Git and creating a GitHub account, I initialized a new Git repository for my project by following these steps:

Open the Command Prompt or Git Bash.
Navigate to the project directory using the cd command.
Run git init to initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
Run git add . to stage all files for the initial commit.
Run git commit -m "Initial commit" to create the initial commit.
Create a new repository on GitHub by following the instructions on the GitHub website.
Associate the local repository with the remote GitHub repository by running git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>.
Run git push -u origin master to push the initial commit to the remote repository.

5. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

or this project, I have chosen to work with Python as the primary programming language. Python is a versatile and widely-used language known for its simplicity, readability, and vast collection of libraries and frameworks.
Python Installation Steps:

Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org
Download the latest version of Python for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

6. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

Python comes with a built-in package manager called pip (Python Package Installer), which is used to install and manage third-party packages and libraries.
To ensure that pip is up-to-date, run the following command in the Command Prompt or terminal:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

7. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

Database Installation
For this project, I have chosen to use MySQL as the database management system. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system widely used in web applications and data-driven projects.
MySQL Installation Steps:

Visit the official MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Download the latest version of the MySQL Installer for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

8. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.



9. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

Visual Studio Code offers a vast ecosystem of extensions and plugins to enhance its functionality. For this project, I have installed the following extensions:

Python Extension: Provides rich support for the Python language, including code linting, formatting, debugging, and code completion.
Git Extension: Integrates Git functionality directly within Visual Studio Code, allowing for easier version control operations.
Docker Extension: Simplifies the process of working with Docker containers and images.

To install an extension in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or using the Ctrl+Shift+X shortcut.
Search for the desired extension in the search bar.
Click on the "Install" button next to the extension you want to install.


10. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
